For this project, I implemented and evaluated a program in OpenCL that counts stars. The program loads a photo of the night sky and counts the number of stars using a parallel algorithm. I ported a provided sequential implementation in Python to OpenCL. Then, I optimized the parallel implementation using different techniques. Finally, I evaluated the program to ensure correctness and measure performance. OpenCL is a framework allowing heterogeneous computing across various platforms by enabling execution of parallel code on CPUs, GPUs, and other processors.
